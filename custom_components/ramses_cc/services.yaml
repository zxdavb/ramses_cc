    appropriate class and faking enabled.

# If the service accepts entity IDs, target allows the user to specify entities by
# entity, device, or area. If `target` is specified, `entity_id` should not be defined
# in the `fields` map. By default it shows only targets matching entities from the same
# domain as the service, but if further customization is required, target supports the
# entity, device, and area selectors
# (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/).
# Entity selector parameters will automatically be applied to device and area, and
# device selector parameters will automatically be applied to area
