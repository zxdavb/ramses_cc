# integration-wide service calls

fake_device:
  name: Fake a RAMSES device
  description: >-
    Fake a device, so that it can then cast state data via HA service calls.

    For example, a faked thermostat can be used as a zone sensor to send an explicitly
    specified current temperature to the controller instead of a real thermostat.

    If required, a virtual device can be created, or you can fake an existing device
    (physical devices will continue to cast state date, and so should be deactivated to
    avoid confusion).

    If required, the device can be caused to immediately engage its binding mode.

  fields:
    device_id:
      name: Device ID
      description: >-
        The device ID (a RAMSES ID, not an entity_id).

      required: true

    create_device:
      name: Enable faking
      description: >-

      selector:
        boolean

# Entity selector parameters will automatically be applied to device and area, and
